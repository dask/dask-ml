``dask-ml`` is a library for parallel and distributed machine learning.

Single Machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*``dask-ml`` helps parallelize machine learning workloads that fit on a single-machine.*

If your dataset fits in RAM, ``dask-ml`` can help you fit more models in less
time, by

1. Using all the cores available on your machine.
2. Using dask's intelligent data-hashing to avoid redundant computation

See :ref:`single-machine` for more.

Distributed Learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*``dask-ml`` implements distributed machine learning algorithms*

``dask.array`` and ``dask.dataframe`` scale out to process data on a cluster of
computers. ``dask-ml`` implements distributed algorithms that operate on dask
collections.

Additionally, ``dask-ml`` can peer with other distributed machine learning
framework like `XGBoost`_ or `tensorflow`_. See :ref:`distributed` for more.
